#judoNative SDK for Xamarin

The judoPay library lets you integrate card payments into your Xamarin project. It is built to be mobile first with ease of integration in mind. Judo's SDK enables a faster, simpler and more secure payment experience within your app. Build trust and user loyalty in your app with our secure and intuitive UX.

## Requirements

Xamarin developer licence

[Judo Account]( https://www.judopay.com/docs/ "JudoPay") (click get started)

Thats it!

## Installation

####[Xamarin Component Store]( https://components.xamarin.com/view/judopay-xamarin-sdk "Component Store")
-   Within Xamarin Studio- Project/Get More Components - Search "JudoPay" and add to app
-   Click download from the above link and unzip the .Xam file and run the install command using the xamarin-component.exe above
  -  mono xamarin-component.exe install /path/to/your.xam (mac)
  -  xamarin-component.exe install /path/to/your.xam (windows)
  -  You can also download the component .xam from this page component/judopay-xamarin-sdk-2.0.xam

####Here!
-  Fork the SDK and build it yourself. It won't bite.
-  Again download the component .xam from this page component/judopay-xamarin-sdk-2.3.0.xam

####Nuget
-  Coming soon

####Getting started

Ready to start integrating? This tutorial will help you get started with integrating judo with your Xamarin Mobile Application.

### Step 1 

You can create your judo account by clicking “Get Started” here: [https://www.judopay.com/docs/](https://www.judopay.com/docs/)

### Step 2 

Once registered, you will receive an email providing you with temporary login details and will be asked to reset your password to a memorable, strong password. Once logged in, you'll be able to download our SDKs, access development tools, run test transactions in our Sandbox environment and be able to add and administer your first App by following the on-screen steps.

### Step 3 

Add the following code snippet to your project upon start up or before making your transaction call. This is best done within the appDelegates FinishedLaunching method (iOS) or within the apps initial activity's OnCreate() method (Android). Specifying your ApiToken, ApiSecret and Judo ID which you can find in the Dashboard (this code snippet is configured to operate in Sandbox environment. If you are planning to integrate in Live, please change the necessary information listed in the going live document):

## Configuration

``` csharp
var configInstance = JudoConfiguration.Instance;

    //setting for SandBox
    configInstance.Environment = JudoEnvironment.Sandbox;

    configInstance.ApiToken =  "{ApiToken}";
    configInstance.ApiSecret = "{ApiSecret}";
    configInstance.JudoId =    "{JudoID}";


    // setting up 3d secure, AVS, Amex and mestro card support (optional configuration)
    Judo.Instance.AVSEnabled = true;
    Judo.Instance.AmExAccepted = true;
    
    //Android requires no specified instance
    Judo.MaestroAccepted = true;

    // this will turn on UI mode which will hand over control to our out of 
    //the box UI solution
    Judo.UIMode = true;
```

**Please note:** You can configure judoPay library to use live environment by changing the third parameter in `SetApiTokenAndSecret ()`from `Environment.Sandbox` to `Environment.live`


### Card payments

Now that you've configured your SDK with your API Tokens and Secrets, you're ready to use the Judo instance to process payments. 

By calling the following with the SDK Manager (Judo.cs), you'll invoke judo's UI to enter card data and submit the payment request:

```csharp
//Define a success block
private void JudoSuccessPayment(PaymentReceiptModel receipt)
     {
     // handle receipt
     }
//Define a Failure block
private void JudoFailurePayment(JudoError error, PaymentReceiptModel receipt)
     {
     // handle errors or Declined cards
     }

//Pass through the payment you would like to facilitate
var paymentViewModel = new PaymentViewModel
     {
      Amount = 4.5m, 
      ConsumerReference = consumerRef,
      Currency = "GBP",
      Card = new CardViewModel()
     };

//Let Judo do the rest
 //iOS
Judo.Instance.Payment (PaymentViewModel payment, JudoSuccessCallback success, JudoFailureCallback failure)

//Android
Judo.Instance.Payment (PaymentViewModel payment, JudoSuccessCallback success, JudoFailureCallback failure, Activity context) 

```
####Note: 
This callback should be non-blocking

### Apple Pay

The iOS implementation supports Apple Pay on payments and pre-authorizations.

To integrate Apple Pay within your app, you must set it up at the judo Account level ([guide here](https://www.judopay.com/docs/v4_6/apple-pay/quickstart/)), as well as make some changes to your application's settings.

Add this block of code in your application's Entitlements.Plist:
```
<dict>
<key>com.apple.developer.in-app-payments</key> 
<array> 
<string>INSERT-MERCHANT-NAME-HERE</string> 
</array>
</dict>
```

After you are all set up, making an Apple Pay transaction is just as easy as before.

#### Payments

Apple Pay
```

//Construct the viewModel

//note summaryItems are optional and don't
//need to be used in a single item top up scenario

var summaryItems = new PKPaymentSummaryItem[] {
				new PKPaymentSummaryItem () {
					Amount = new NSDecimalNumber ("0.90"),
					Label = @"Judo Burrito"

				},
				new PKPaymentSummaryItem () {
					Amount = new NSDecimalNumber ("0.10"),
					Label = @"Extra Guac"

				}
			};
			
			var applePayViewModel = new ApplePayViewModel {
				
				CurrencyCode = new NSString ("GBP"),
				CountryCode = new NSString (@"GB"),
				SupportedNetworks = new NSString[3]{
			            new NSString (PassKit.PKPaymentNetwork.Visa),
			            new NSString (PassKit.PKPaymentNetwork.MasterCard),
			            new NSString (PassKit.PKPaymentNetwork.Amex)
                		},
				SummaryItems = summaryItems,
				TotalSummaryItem = new PKPaymentSummaryItem () {
					Amount = new NSDecimalNumber ("1.00"),//total of the previous items
					Label = @"El Judorito" // who the transaction is made out to pay

				},
				ConsumerRef=new NSString (@"GenerateYourOwnCustomerRefHere"),
				MerchantIdentifier = new NSString ("INSERT_MERCHANT_ID_HERE")

			};

Judo.Instance.MakeApplePayment (applePayViewModel payment, SuccessCallback success, FailureCallback failure)

```

#### Pre-authorization
Apple Pay
```
Judo.Instance.MakeApplePreAuth (applePayViewModel payment, SuccessCallback success, FailureCallback failure)
```

### Non UIMode

Changing the property below to false enables non UIMode
```
    Judo.UIMode = false;
```

If you choose to create your own custom UI and gather the card details yourself you can provide the same calls documented above with the completed viewModel (excluding Apple Pay) and make payments in the same callback completion manner as before. Please note doing so brings you into the scope of PCI DSS and you are subject third party stringent audits

**Note**  when using non UI calls to the API you must recycle the session using the below call, before making further calls. This is to insure unique payment reference
```
Judo.Instance.CycleSession(); 
```

add the key below to the info.plist of your app if 3D Secure view does not load properly.
```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key> 
<dict> 
<key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key><true/> 
</dict> 
```
